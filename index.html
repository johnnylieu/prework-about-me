      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am on my way to software development. Some may see code as a mess, bunch of letters jumbled up togehter. I see code as art and a puzzle which once completed shows the coder's art/creativity.</p>

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a software developer?</h1>
      <p>I like a challenge, I like solving puzzles. I used to code when I was 11 (I wish I didn't give it up but as they say, "it's never to late to start.. again") and I honestly think I invented pop ups.</p>
